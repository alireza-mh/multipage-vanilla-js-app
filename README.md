# multipage-vanilla-js-app

### What is
This boilerplate helps with web application with only vanilla js. It supports multipage and each page gonna have it's own html.
You can use common components and utility function and each page gonna bundle all of the used one so it's not very efficient if these pages gonna be connect to each other. 
So what are the use cases?

### Why
Imagin that you have to deal with some dynamic page, Asume payment page. You have a mobile application that user can add to their credit via bank gateway page. so here you can redirect to a page from bank gateway and you need to show appropriate message(sucess/fail) to the user. So mobile user should not download React, vue or any other framework to only see simple page. it's why you can use this boilerplate.
